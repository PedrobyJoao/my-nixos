### Home Manager

Standalone Home-Manager for now, I may make it as a module in the future.

Also, since I'm using standalone HM, I noticed that when updating my flakes, I should update both flakes
of my NixOS config and the flake of my home-manager. Otherwise, updating just one of them might result in errors
(obviously).
